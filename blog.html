    <p>This is my blog~!</p>

	<br>
	<p> I actually had a lot of trouble with this assignment. This is my first term here, at OSU, and learning OSU's system
		for doing things was not easy for me. I had to ask many people for help while doing this assignment. The HTML
		was actually the easiest part for me, but posting it on my engineering account, and using GitHub was not so 
		easy for me.</p>

	<p> I learned how to navigate OSU a little better by having to locate the help desk on several occasions. I also learned
		that HTML isn't that hard at all to pick up. </p>
	<p> I had to use Piazza for help many times, but ultimately what helped me the most was someone sitting
		down and showing me how to use GIT, and Github. </p>
