	<center><p> Honestly, I had a lot of trouble with this assignment. This is my first term here, and I didn't
		Know how to use the public_html thing, and I didn't even know how to access it. I went to the Engineering helpdesk often for help in navigating the OSU 
		network. They helped a lot! I also asked for help from a few students in the class! Thank you a ton!!!! :D  </p>

	<p> I learned how to navigate OSU's campus a little better, since I had to walk around for help. I also used this <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruieT3Nkg2M" > video </a>
		to help me push the signment in GitBash. I later learned that I can just use the Desktop GitHub download to sync my work. That was much simpler for a beginner. </p>

	<p> I had to use Piazza for help many times, but ultimately what helped me the most was someone sitting
		down and showing me how to use GIT, and Github. </p> </center>
