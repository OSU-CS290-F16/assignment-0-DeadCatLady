		<p style = "font-size:30px"> Hey there everyone, my name is Christa.  Here is a little about myself. </p>

        		<ul align = "left",  style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">

         			<li> My major is computer science!  </li>

         			<li> I feel 4/10 on the confidence scale of my HTML abilities. That is, I feel like I can work with it, and produce something that doesn't
				     look terrible, but I'm still at level 40 with my skills. In the past I played with the HTML
				     code on webpages and such, but have not really made something that is a stand-alone website.</li>
				
				<li> In this class I hope to learn how to make a nice looking webpage. I don't know too much about web
					page development, but learning this skill would be super awesome! </li>

				<li> I have signed up for Piazza, and even posted in it! </li>

				<li> I think the most interesting thing I have done is worked in a Juvenile Detention. I don't think many people 
					have gotten the chance to work in such a facility. I learned a lot while working there, and it made me
					want to return to school. </li>

         		</ul>
